•	Terraform can connect to providers such as AWS, Azure, Github, GCP, Alibaba etc. Terraform providers’ reference: https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers
•	Providers are a logical abstraction of an upstream API. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources.
•	AWS resources are EC2, Security Group, Route53 etc.


Key Points About Providers:

Provider Definition: Providers must be defined in your Terraform configuration file (.tf) to specify which service you're interacting with (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).

API Authentication: Most providers require credentials (such as API keys or tokens) to authenticate Terraform and allow it to manage resources on the platform.

Provider-Specific Resources: Each provider comes with its own set of supported resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets for AWS).

Versioning: Providers can have different versions, and you can specify which version to use to ensure consistency and avoid breaking changes.

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance in AWS is a virtual server that allows you to run applications in the cloud.
